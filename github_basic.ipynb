    "## Git Basic commands\n",
    "- First create a new repository in Github\n",
    "    - Go to github\n",
    "    - Create New \n",
    "    - For the time being leave all options as default and make it public.\n",
    "    - `Click Create`\n",
    "    - `Clicking Create` will take you to a page with basic git commands to help comit the file.\n",
    "- Create a directory using the terminal\n",
    "    - use `ls` command to display all the folders in the current directory.\n",
    "    - use `cd <directory name >to enter into any dircetory.\n",
    "        - use the entire path insted of single directory name if you know it.\n",
    "        - **note** \n",
    "            - if the directory names contains spaces, terminal commands may not recognise it.\n",
    "            - use`my_directory' instead of `my directory'\n",
    "    - create new dir using command `mkdir <dir name>\n",
    "    - Enter the new dir created using `cd <dir name>'\n",
    "    - **Follow the instructions in the github page**\n",
    "        - first comd is `echo`\n",
    "            - syntax is echo \"# Github_Basics\" >> README.md\n",
    "                - What ever is in the \"\" will get written to a file named README.md\n",
    "            - here we are creating a simple Readme file with a single line in it.\n",
    "            - use `ls` and see that README.md is displayed\n",
    "            - `cat <filename>` in this case `cat <README.md>`\n",
    "                - cat command wwill display what is in the file\n",
    "         - Initilising a Git repository for the forlder which is created\n",
    "            - use command `git init`\n",
    "            - this will initiate an empty repository for the folder and will track all the changes and files in it.\n",
    "         - Configuring git \n",
    "            - This is a one time measure and need not be repeated here after.\n",
    "            - This is done to connect the local machine with github.\n",
    "            - Configuration is done based on email and username. For this we use the following commands\n",
    "                - `git config user.name <your github username>`\n",
    "                -  `git config user.email <your username liked to github profile>`\n",
    "                - It will ask for password then use the token as passwords are now obselete in git.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Check if the config is working use\n",
    "                - `git config user.name` & `git config user.email` and it will show you the user name and email\n",
    "        - Adding new file\n",
    "            - before adding check the status using `git status`\n",
    "            - At this stage this command will show the README.md file in read as it is untracked.\n",
    "            - it will also display 'No commits yet' , 'Nothing added to commit but untracked files present'\n",
    "            - `git add <file name>` to add the file to staging and then check status again.\n",
    "                - Adding file will take it to tracking mode from untrack mode.\n",
    "                - Status will show the file in green, bust will still show no commits yet\n",
    "        - Commiting the added file\n",
    "            - use `git comit -m \"<message>\"\n",
    "            - -m stands for message and whatever is written in \" \" followed by -m will be displayed along with the commited file.\n",
    "            - messages are useful while colaborating or looking at the files later to see what was it about.\n",
    "            - Press enter and the message will be shown along with 1 file change/// 1 insertion. This means we have added one new file\n",
    "            - use `git status' and we see the display saying nothing to commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Renaming the branch\n",
    "            - use `git branch -M <new name>`\n",
    "            - This will change the name of the branch to  'new name' you wish to give.\n",
    "            - for eg you cna change default 'master' to 'main'\n",
    "            - `git branch` will display the current branch you are working on.\n",
    "        - Linking repository and local machine folder.\n",
    "            - Before we can push the files to git repository we need to link th efolder in th elocal machine and the repository\n",
    "            - Please note that we did the config and that was a one time thing.\n",
    "            - But for every repository we need to link the repository url to the folder in the local machine.\n",
    "            - For this go to the github and copy the url, then use following command\n",
    "            - `git remote add origin <url>`\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Pushing the file to the repository\n",
    "            - use `git -u push origin <branch name>' \n",

    "            - type in the username and passowrd prompt will be shown\n",
    "            - Getting token.\n",
